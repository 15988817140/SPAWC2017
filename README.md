# SPAWC_2017
Python code to reproduce our works on DNN research: Training Deep Neural Networks for Wireless Resource Management.

Demo.py contains the whole process from data generation, training, testing to plotting, even though such process done on a small dataset, 94% accuracy can still be easily attained in less than 100 iterations.

In test.py, we do testing process based on the pre-trained model trained on our original one million data set, which shows the exact result appears in our paper.

All codes have been tested successfully on Python 3.6.0 with TensorFlow 1.0.0 and Numpy 1.12.0 support.
